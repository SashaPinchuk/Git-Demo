Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field
the end

Sally called back and asked
how I felt
And she said, hey I know
how to help - get over Alice
She said now Alice is gone
but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting for twenty-four years
And the big limousine disappeared
