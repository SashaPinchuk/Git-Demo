Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field
the end

Sally called back and asked
how I felt
And she said, hey I know
how to help - get over Alice
She said now Alice is gone
but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting for twenty-four years
And the big limousine disappeared

I don't know why she's leaving,
or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
but I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waiting for the chance
To tell her how I feel
and maybe get a second glance
Now I've got to get used
to not living next door to Alice
